<h1>2. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT</h1>


<h2>2.1 Approach and Assumptions</h2>

<p>An &quot;expert system&quot; approach was used based on available data and the
collective knowledge and experience of people involved with land science and the rating of
land suitability for crop production throughout the country. The CLI system (ARDA, 1965)
was used as a general framework as it has proven useful and it is familiar to people
involved with all aspects of land evaluation. Thus, a seven class system was chosen with
Class I having the highest suitability (least limitations) and Class 7 having the lowest
suitability (greatest limitations). The component breakdown and specific factor ratings
follow the early approach of Stone (1933) and more recently that of the Alberta Soils
Advisory Committee (1987).</p>

<p>Changes from the CLI are reflected in some of the following guidelines and assumptions:

<ol>
  <li>The system is interpretive and based on limitations for crop production. The framework
    of the system is suitable for all crops but specific rating factors are developed,
    initially, for only spring-seeded small grains (wheat, barley, oats), crops which can be
    grown in all the agricultural regions of Canada.</li>
  <li>The system recognizes three major components that determine the suitability of land for
    crops: climate, soils and landscape. Each component is rated separately and assigned a
    value between 0 and 100. The final land suitability rating is based on the most limiting
    of the three, not on the accumulated total.</li>
  <li>Distance to market, availability of land transportation, size of farm, cultural
    patterns, and exceptional skill or resources of the farm operator are not criteria for
    this classification.</li>
  <li>Permafrost affected soils are not considered separately because once
    land is cleared of its vegetative cover the permafrost recedes to a depth greater than 1
    metre.</li>
  <li>The interpretations are subject to change as new information on soil
    response to management becomes available. New technology may also require changes in the
    classification.</li>
  <li>Organic soils are rated for the same crops as mineral soils.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a basis for developing specific ratings for various factors, the following
relationship was established:</p>

<h2>2.2 System Description</h2>

<p>The system has two categories: &quot;Classes&quot; based on the degree of limitation of
land for production of the specified crop or crops (LSRS Manual Table 2.1), and
&quot;Subclasses&quot; based on the kind of limitation. This information is useful for
land use planning and for determining conservation and management requirements. The first
three classes are considered suitable for sustained production of the crop in question,
Class 4 is considered marginal, and Classes 5 to 7 are not considered capable of
supporting sustained production of the crop using presently recommended practices.
Subclasses reflect the kind of climate, soil and landscape limitations.</p>

<p>Provision is made for a third category &quot;Units&quot; which are groupings of
soil-landscapes based on management considerations. For example, all areas having similar
requirements for conservation practices, or drainage, or fertility amendments might be
grouped. This category has not been developed here but attempts have been made where
intensive land management is practiced (cf Luttmerding, 1984).</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that land areas assigned to the same suitability class are
similar only with respect to the degree, and not the kind, of limitation for production of
a crop. Each class can include different soil and landscape characteristics which may
require different management practices.</p>

<h3>2.2.3 Units (management groups)</h3>

<p>Units should be considered as soil management groups. That is, groupings of soils or
map units with similar relevance and response to a particular management objective. It is
suggested that criteria and groupings could change with objective of decision and scale of
data or application. These types of groupings are more appropriate at levels of detailed
land management such as individual farms or site plans and the need for national
guidelines has not been established. However, some general statements are included for
orientation.</p>

<p>The original concept (Klingebiel and Montgomery, 1961) was that the capability unit
should group soils that were nearly alike in their suitability for plant growth and
responses to management. Thus, soils in the same unit should be sufficiently uniform to
(a) produce similar kinds of cultivated crops and pasture plants with similar management
practices, (b) require similar conservation treatment and management under the same kind
and condition of plant cover, and (c) have comparable potential productivity. The
principal control-ling parameters are texture, drainage, slope and climate although others
such as fertility requirements, salinity or stoniness can be locally important.</p>





<h2>2.3 Information Requirements</h2>

<p>Use of the rating system requires information for each factor within the climate, soil
and landscape components. The information may be for a specific site or estimated from
maps, reports and local information. In some cases, data for factors can be estimated from
data for other parameters. For example, the AWC can be estimated from information on
texture and structure, or the water table of undrained mineral soils might be estimated
from the classification of the soil. The level and purpose of the suitability rating have
a bearing on the degree of specificity of the data required. Regional assessments of the
suitability of land can generally be made using published data. Assessments of specific
tracts of land for the production of specified crops, however, usually require specific
data for the sites involved, including on-site inspection, unless the available data are
unusually comprehensive.</p>
