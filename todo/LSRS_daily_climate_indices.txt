do not want to model growth, much too complicated.
instead use some simple indices that give good general predictions of suitability

Currently use:
 - growing season length (GSL)
 - crop heat units (CHU)
 - growing degree days (GDD)
 - effective growing degree days (EGDD)
 - seasonal P-PE (PPE)

could add:
 - moderate growing degree days (MGDD) (from 5 to 25 degrees, where below 5 = 0, and degrees above 25 are subtracted from 25)


 and some special factors:
  - too hot at critical times (e.g. canola flowering)
 
 
 Could add:
  - Excessive Moisture for Germination (EMG)
		- typical number of days from GSS to GSS+40 where P-PE > 0
		point deductions = {0=>0, 10=>0, 15=>5, 20=>15, 30=>40, 35=>60, 40=>70}

	- Insufficient Moisture for Germination (IMG)
		- typical P-PE for the period GSS to GSS+30
		point deductions = {-50=>0, -150=>20, -300=>70}

	- Excessive Moisture for Maturation (EMM)
		- typical number of days from EGDD1200 to EGDD2000 (crop specific) where P-PE > 0
		point deductions = {20=>0, 40=>10, 60=>30, 80=>50}

	- Insufficient Moisture for Maturation (IMM)
		- (number of consecutive days where P-PE < -5)
		- (maximum PE-P)
		- [typical?] number of days in any 40 day mid to end-growth period where P-PE < -5
		point deductions = {10=>0, 20=>10, 25=>30, 30=>40, 40=>70}
		
	- Excessive Moisture for Harvest (EMH)
	 - assume harvest from EGDD2000 to EGDD2000+45 (crop specific)
		SSSG
	 - typical number of days from EGDD1200 to EGDD1600+45 where P-PE > 0
	 - point deductions (sssg) = {5=>0, 25=>25, 35=>50, 45=>70}
		CORN
	 - typical number of days from EGDD2300 to Dec 31 where P-PE > 0
	 - point deductions (corn) = {40=>0, 60=>10, 100=>30, 45=>70}
	 
	 excessively intense rainfall events
		- maximum rainfall in one day?
 
 all of these "typical" values could be:
	- actual values recorded for one individual year
	- median values calculated for a decade
	
	for "maximum" or "minimum" values:
	-	probability of surpassing a threshold per year
	
	** look up Tony's old emails re. small fruits and threaten Scott that I'll code them
 
 Assume crops are planted in the spring once threshold conditions are reached.

CODE:

deductions = YAML.load_file("#{Rails.root.to_s}/LSRS_daily_climate_indices.yml")
