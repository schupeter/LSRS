<b> Definition </b><br />
Average potential evapotranspiration (PE) for barley, (mm)<br /><br />
<b> Method of calculation </b><br />
Sum of average daily values of Potential evapotranspiration (PE) from GDD2Start to STOPBarley. 
If STOPBarley is later than GDD2Stop (estimated average date of first fall frost), then accumulation is stopped on GDD2Stop.
PE is calculated using the Baier-Roberson formulae (Baier and Robertson, 1965; Baier, 1971) by default, or as selected by the user.
