<p>According to Bootsma and Boisvert (1991) it requires about 480 GDDs (Growing Degree Days > 5<sup>o</sup>C) to produce a first cut of alfalfa and one should allow for about 450 GDDs for crop carryover requirements. Therefore the minimum heat requirement for alfalfa is about 930 GDDs. This was considered the "marginal" requirement or the Class 4-5 boundary. The minimum requirement for Class 1 was taken as the ability to support 3 cuts per year. This translates into (3 x 480) + 450 = 1890 GDDs. The ability to support two cuts per year, ((2x480) + 450 = 1410 GDDs) should be in Class 3. The ability to produce one cut with no carry over (480 GDDs) should represent the Class 5-6 boundary.</p>
<p>Based on the above considerations and subsequent validation of ratings, deductions were assigned as follows:</p>
