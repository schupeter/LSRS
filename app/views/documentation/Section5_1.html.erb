<p>Organic soils are those which have greater than 40
cm of peat (greater than 60 cm of fluffy fibric peat) (Expert Committee on Soil Survey,
1987). Organic soils having permafrost (Organic Cryosols) are treated as organic soils for
the purpose of this rating system.</p>

<p>These soils present many unique features including
low bulk density, high water holding capacity, relatively cold soil climate and usually
deficient fertility status (Mathur and Lévesque, 1987). Notwithstanding, the system
proposed here is based on the same crops and is an extension of the mineral soil rating
with appropriate modifications. Classifying land dominated by organic soils in this system
involves rating the same three components:<br>
- climate<br>
- soil<br>
- landform</p>

<p>There are some differences, however, both in the specific factors considered in the soil components and in the relative
importance of the components. For example, because organic soils are colder than the
associated mineral soils, soil temperature is introduced as a factor for organic soils.</p>

<h2>5.1 Temperature Deduction (Z)</h2>

<p> Microclimates of organic soils are commonly colder
than those of associated mineral soils because of differences in soil thermal properties
and because organic soils usually occupy low positions in the landscape which are subject
to cold air pooling. This is particularly important in the colder regions of the country
where growing season length is already a limiting factor. To take account of this a
separate deduction of up to 25 points is made for organic soils (Table 5.2).</font></p>

<p> The cutoff values in Table 5.2 were used to produce the linear equation below.
The graphical representation of this equation is used to determine point deductions for Heat Unit values
