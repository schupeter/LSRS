<h1>3.2 Temperature Factor (H)</h1>

<p>The temperature factor is based on an effective <i>growing </i>degree day (EGDD)
calculation which includes length of season, degree days and day length. Growing degrees
days were accumulated beginning 10 days after the average date when the mean daily
temperature reached 5 degrees C (April 1 was the earliest possible starting date).  This
approximates date of seeding. The end of the growing season was represented by the average
date of the first frost after July 15 (October 31 was taken as the latest possible
end date). The GDDs were calculated from the average mean daily air temperatures computed
from monthly normal values.</p>

<p>The GDD value was adjusted to recognize the effect of the longer day length in the
north (Alberta Soils Advisory Committee, 1987).  The value of the modification
varies from 0% at 49 degrees N to 18% at 64 degrees N latitude. The adjusted value was
considered to be the Effective GDD (EGDD).</p>

<p>The critical points used for development of the rating, based on requirements for
spring-seeded small grains and farming experience were:</p>
